Rudely demanded of photo ID and notified a charge of £250 would be taken for evidence of drug use. I am a professional business customer and this was so poorly judged by staff. I was told I was emailed on booking that cash deposit of £100 would be demanded on booking 2 weeks prior. Communication was provided on the day at 9.00am via booking.com email and was not seen due to being at work. Was told I should walk to a cash point in the rain with little direction as to where the nearest cash point was. It was pouring with rain, getting dark and I was a lone female customer. Receptionist replied that she was happy to cancel my booking if I preferred . The day of the queen's return to buckingham Palace with no chance of securing an alternative hotel. After returning with the cash I was given a key card with no holder with room number on. I made my way to my room after clarifying room number twice, staff area doors in corridors left open exposing dirty laundry, key card device broken off door, semen stains on wall, public hair on top of bed sheets. Mortified, so much so I didn't get under the sheets for fear of what I would find. Tried to have a wash to find the shower gel had been topped up 3 quarters with water from a previous guest.

She was so rude as I was simply asking her a tower for my child 3 times, but she just keep shouting to me later later and then she didn’t providing anything.   After that I just told her about the room’s problems. There were so many flies inside, the shower was smelly, no towers, and it sinking everywhere, but she’s just denied and said that was the standard room. And they said there’s no service room like cleaning. They just clean the room after 1 week.   When I was here I can see, that wasn’t only me. There were so many customers made the complaints as the rooms weren’t same as pictures on the website. 1 lady was crying as the staff refused to cancel for her and said she doesn’t care. If she want to cancel, she will loose her money. Other man got pissed of with the same situation of the room was completely different with what they saw online.   They even forced me to check out at 9am instead of 11:00 as normal even though our room is prepaid but it took forever for check in as they said there was no booking for us. Many times I asked them please double check, but the manager asked us to leave otherwise they will call the police. That was so horrible when I got a young child, and that was late night.   I would advise everyone not to book in advance, better not to stay.",

This is the worst hotel I've ever used there must be better for the price. Door is left open in the night and reception is rarely manned.

Best thing about the hotel in my opinion was the spa / pool. Very relaxing to be able to lounge by the pool after using the sauna (which was a great temperature) and you are provided a robe and slippers to make it even more comfortable. The white company shower gels / shampoo and moisturiser are all very nice. Only negative is I think they have been watered down a bit. Overall great!",

We just used the Wetherspoons over the road, we’re not massive foodies so don’t care what we eat, but the restaurant did smell delicious. We used the bar when we came in at about 10pm it was nice and quiet. Prices what you expect from a nice hotel.\nThe pool, sauna and steam room are well maintained and provide some lovely downtime from a day round London.\nWould definitely stay again.",

The main lobby is dark and has a smell, the lounge and bar area is closed and is being refurbished with carpets and mattresses around. We was lucky to get a refurbished room. It was clean and well maintained. No air conditioning but didn’t expect that with a place so old, could of done with a fan far to hot. Cold water tap in the bathroom didn’t work. Mattress was fairly hard but it was brand new. It will do for a 1 night stay and is in a good location to most things. Staff were very polite and welcoming.",

Unfortunately roads around the area have suspended parking or for residents only.  I decided to check in and seek advise. The smell of body sweat in reception was horrendous and not only was this contributed by contractors, but also male personnel from the hotel. The hotel reception decor dates back to late 80’s so not a great impression. Anyhow having checked in I asked about parking and was told that the only place was at Swiss Cottage with a company called Regency Parking (this a 15min walk back to hotel). This was my only choice to park so I decided to try it. I arrived at 18.30 so the parking charge would £15 until 23.59 then another £15 from then because it’s another day. This was a total rip off so I didn’t even return to the hotel and went somewhere else considering the bad feeling I had of the hotel and the parking inconvenience. I will never book this hotel again.

Since the reception closed at 8, people need to use key card to enter, our daughter went out at night whereas we stayed in the room, the problem was the room needed to insert the key card to activate the lights. Finally the staff gave us a fake key card to solve the problem. There was no replacement of shower gels making the shower without gels. We needed to get small bottle of bath gels from the reception. It was a bit noisy at night in our lower ground floor room. Good thing was the hotel provided 3 pack of biscuits for drinking the coffee in the morning.",

Nie wspomnę o tym , że znajomość języka angielskiego zwłaszcza podczas obsługi w restauracji jest bardzo słaba.  W hotelu miałem 2 rezerwację po 2 pokoje. Najpierw spędziłem że znajomymi 1 noc przed wycieczką do Kambodży.  Już wtedy miałem duze obawy,  że mam tu wrócić. Niestety personel w recepcji nie mógł sobie poradzić aby cześć pobytu opłacić punktami.  Personel nie potrafi pracować w systemie All ACCOR.  I stąd taka nie kompetencja. Niestety musiałem się upominiiec o podniesienie standardu pokoju,  bo nikt by się nie domyślił.  W pokoju były duze braki. Nie było zestawów do golenia,  szczoteczki do zębów i innych artykułów higienicznych, które są dostępne w większości hoteli w sieci Accor w Bangkoku. Brak kapci,  czy szlafroków.  kolejna rzecz to w łazience tylko jedna rolka papieru toaletowego. To dziwna polityka tego hotelu.  Najgorsze śniadania jakie jadłem w hotelu w Tajlandii.  Tak ubogie menu, że nie było z czego wybierać.  2 rodzaje soków,  bardzo słabej jakości.  I przez 4 dni pobytu zawsze te same owoce, arbuz i melon.  Bardzo mały wybór w produktach.  A osoby wegetarianie nie mieli co jeść. Nie rozumiem polityki hotelu, że można zamówić tylko jedno danie śniadaniowe z karty, przy tak ubogim bufecie śniadaniowym. I nawet te dania z karty,  były beznadziejne i słabe.  To wstyd, hak można podawać tak zrobione gofry, albo jajka po benedyktyńsku. obrzydliwe to było. A szef kuchni przyszedł i tłumaczył, że zespół się uczy. kolejny dział nie jest przygotowany do pracy w tym hotelu. W jeden dzień gdy przeszliśmy na śniadanie,  to na bufecie były tylko wystawione 2 Soki.  A personel tłumaczył, że nie ma dużego obłożenia i nie robią bufetu,  tylko trzeba zamówić wszystko do stolika.  To jest nie dopomyslenia.  Po pierwszym dniu, zgłosiłem wszystko do kierownka zmiany w recepcji i zapewnieniono mnie ze to zostanie przekazane do menadżera hotelu.  Jestem rozczarowany, bo nikt w hotelu nie wyróżnił mojego dnia urodzin 2 marca. Choć menadżer zmiany wiedział o moich urodzinach.  Przez 4 dni nie widziałem menadżera w hotelu. O Wszystko zespół pytał się i pisał maile i dzwonił do menadżera. Nikt nie porozmawiał z nami , że tak wyglądał pobytu.  Nic się nie zmieniło.. Wogole uznawanie statusu to jakiś zart. Ten hotel jest bardzo źle prowadzony.  On powinien być jeszcze zamknięty.  Tam nic nie jest gotowe , niedopracowane i nie wyszkolony personel. Na basenie brak parasoli, wszystko jest na słońcu,  nie można się nigdzie przed nim schronić.  Na basenie ręczniki, białe i dużo za małe.  Powinny być ręczniki plażowe i to w innym kolorze niż białe. Jak funkcjonuje ten hotel, że brakuje w nim żeby były menadżer hotelu. Nie ma z kim porozmawiać o problemach. Byliśmy w sumie w 7 osób,  i wszyscy byli zgodni że to bardzo słaby hotel, który niestety ma potencjał,  który nie jest wykorzystany. Żałuję,  ",

Recommended for people with personal cars. The hotel is decorated very chicly. Suitable for teenagers There are many photo corners. The service staff is good. The welcome drink is like a yuzu orange smoothie. Eat and feel happy. I stayed in TRIBE Extra, size 28 sq m. The bedroom and bed were very soft and comfortable. There is a table to sit and eat. There is a sink for washing dishes, a sofa, and a dedicated plug-in zone for charging. The bathroom is a little small. And there is no payment line. (But there is automatic injection) The swimming pool is cool. Not a rooftop The size is not very big, the gym is very good, all the equipment is new, the best quality, and the dining room is very chicly decorated as well. For breakfast, you can choose 1 thing. I chose Japanese fried rice. It was so salty I really couldn't eat it. Overall, I was impressed with the newness and chicness of the hotel. Suitable for teenagers",

The extras served (bread, cheese, fruits) are quite a lot and sad to see food wastage - amenities (grooming kit) in bathroom are not yet complete, but the bath towels are always fresh and fluffy - facility glitches (fire alarm in room sounded off twice on one night and once the next day - both time waking me up in panic!) - wifi in room is unstable. But wifi in public areas are very fast and stable.   Above though are very fixable the longer they operate. The staff are also very helpful and friendly making it a pleasurable stay overall.   Will definitely book here again and hope to see vast improvements next time.",

Around the hotel are Jing' an Temple (better try LongHua temple), new Apple Store and good food options at the Kerry Center. What I like the most is the classical design leather seat (with small table) at the window.",
